## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

I learned how to use Tailwind CSS, using it in a project for the first time. It is quite easy. The only downside I can think of is it could clutter the classname of an element at times. I also learned how to implement Dark Mode toggling by tapping into user's preferences first then providing an option to switch between light and dark themes.


### Continued development

I would like to focus more on server-side-rendering projects, integrating APIs onto frontend and implement more tools like Redux to handle global web application states.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind UI Documentation](https://tailwindui.com/documentation) - Helped me setup Tailwind into the project and get me up to speed on how to use.
- [Custom 404 Page by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#404-page) - I found this useful for setting up a custom 404 page.
- [Lodash library](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) - Tons of useful utility functions to work with strings, arrays and objects.
